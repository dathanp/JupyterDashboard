# JupyterDashboard
CS 340 Client/Server development, I created a dashboard to view and filter rescue dogs using CRUD operations and MongoDB.


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When I was creating the CRUD Python module to connect a dashboard with widgets to a database, I made sure to keep a modular design, make clear naming conventions, document my code, and utilize testing. Following these steps let me have an easier time when it came to debugging and if I wanted to create something similar, I can because of how I created reusable code. I could use this CRUD module in other databases, if I was making a new application then I can use this CRUD module with a few modifications, and I can also use this CRUD module in API development. I can implement this are part of a RESTful API to allow other applications the services my CRUD module provides.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

In order to approach a problem as a computer scientist, I must first understand the requirments of the software to allow specific information is gathered and unneeded information is not. I was able to break down my problems into smaller errors by finding where the program might not be passing the right data. I continuously tested my dashboard to ensure that performance was at its best and bugs would not show up. The main difference from my approach to this project than others is the copmplexity of this assignment. There was many moving parts and if there was a problem in one of the steps, then you would need to locate it or back track. In the future I would like to use prototyping to create mockups so that clients can see possible solutions before launching a large project.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems using technology that involves creating software, organizing data, and keeping it secure. Its important to implement efficient, secure and innovative code because you will save time, create trust and create potential new technologies with your ideas! The impact of my dashboard helps Grazioso by letting them operate more efficiently by comparing other animal shelters data to what the visualized data shows. It lets them make data-driven decisions and lets their company grow because of it.
